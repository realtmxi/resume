    <h3>Tecent FISU AI Arena</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>AI competition collaborated with 2 members, develop RL model for the MOBA game Honour of Kings.</li>
        <li>Competed with teams consisted of graduate/PhD students.</li>
        <li>I propose changing CNN to viT, finetuning hyperparameter and trying new optimizer, highly improve the robustness of our model</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Research Assistant</h3>
    Lee Lab, University of Toronto
    <ul>
        <li>User-Aware MultiLingual Text Simplification. Supervised by Annie Lee</li>
        <li>As co-leader of the team, we are in the annotation and modelling phase.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Estimating Student's Quiz Correctness of Coursera | Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Comparing several traditional ML methods, including KNN, IRT, NN, Ensemble.</li>
        <li>Based on NN model, we modify and apply Transformer model. Verification Set Accuracy hits 72\%, which exceeds all methods above</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Neural Machine Translation From English to French | Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Implementing a seq2seq model, without attention, with single-headed \&with multi-headed attention.</li>
        <li>Training the models with RNN teacher-forcing and decode using beam search.</li>
        <li>Corpus comes from the official records of the 36^th Canadian Parliament. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Identifying Political Persuasion on Reddit | Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Conducted a comprehensive exploratory data analysis of a dataset containing 20,000 Reddit comments, using the SpaCy library to perform NLP tasks including tagging, lemmatization, tokenization, to prepare the data </li>
        <li>Implemented feature extraction to identify the most relevant features</li>
        <li>Conducted a rigorous evaluation of five pre-trained classifiers to select the optimal feature set</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>DogBreed Classification | Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Using CNN and ResNet to classify dog images on DBI and SDD datasets</li>
        <li>Evaluated the performance of different models under specific training epochs.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>{Feature detection and homo transform reconstruction | Python</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Construct a Harris corner detection from the ground to identify the corners and edges in an image.</li>
        <li>Construct a SIFT feature descriptor to evaluate the relationship between images.</li>
        <li>Use homogrpaphy to combine images of object taken at different places, for noise-reduction and super-resolution. Enables similar scanning of target objects like Adobe Scan</li>
    </ul>
